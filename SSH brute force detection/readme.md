# What exactly is SSH?
SSH or Secure shell is a network protocol that enables a secure remote access to a computer.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project's subdomain are:

- Set up Metasploitable as a Wazuh-agent
- Use Kali linux and hydra to execute a brute force attack on the agents open SSH port
- Analyze alerts on the Wazuh dashboard to practice intrusion detection and gain insights on the Threat actor
- Set up an automated threat response

## What is a Brute-force attack??
A brute-force attack involves going through every possible username and password combination to find the correct login details. The time it takes to attain the correct credentials obviously depend on the password strength. A weak password could be gotten in a matter of seconds, while a complex one might take millions of years.
